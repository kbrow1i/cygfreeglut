Subject: freeglut 3.0.0-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* libglut3-3.0.0-1
* libglut-devel-3.0.0-1

freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) library.  GLUT was originally written by Mark Kilgard
to support the sample programs in the second edition OpenGL 'RedBook'.
Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical
applications because it is simple, widely available, and highly
portable.  GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and
manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms
and also read the mouse, keyboard, and joystick functions.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.
